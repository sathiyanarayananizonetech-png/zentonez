## 🎨 Design System (Brand Identity)

### 🌈 Color Palette
The Zentonez palette is a sophisticated, harmonious blend of warm golds and deep contrasts, designed for a luxury aesthetic.

| Color | Hex | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Premium Gold** | `#C9A24A` | Primary brand color, buttons, and high-impact accents |
| **Gold Container** | `#E5C98E` | Lighter gold for backgrounds and soft gradients |
| **Secondary Cream**| `#D9C3A5` | Warm supporting elements and elegant dividers |
| **Deep Navy** | `#1F3A5F` | High-contrast backgrounds and branding accents |
| **Background (Luxury Cream)** | `#F4F1EC` | Main page background for a professional, clean look |
| **Charcoal Typography** | `#2B2B2B` | Core text color for maximum readability |

### 🖋️ Typography
We use a **Fluid Type Scale** implemented via CSS `clamp()` to ensure perfect scaling from mobile notched devices to ultra-wide displays.

| Font Family | Usage | Style |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Poppins** | Primary Headings (H1, H2, H3) | Bold, commanding, and modern |
| **Montserrat** | Secondary Headings (H4, H5, H6) | Elegant and professional |
| **Inter** | Body Text & UI Elements | Clean, readable, and balanced |
| **Pacifico** | Accent Phrases & Hero Subtexts | Script, friendly, and boutique-style |
| **Gelasio** | Narrative & Description text | Sophisticated serif for a literary feel |

## 🪄 Animation & Professional Effects

Zentonez uses a multi-layered animation strategy to create a "living" interface:

- **Smooth Scrolling**: Powered by **Lenis** to provide a cinematic, inertia-based scroll experience.
- **Sparkle Typography**: A custom **3D Kinetic Hover** effect using GSAP and Canvas that adds interactive "sparkles" and character displacement to headings.
- **Luxury Floating**: CSS-optimized `@keyframes` (`luxury-float`) used for subtle, non-blocking movement of decorative elements.
- **Shuffle Grids**: Hero sections utilize **Framer Motion Layout** for randomized, fluid image transitions that change over time.
- **Interactive Buttons**: Premium 3D transforms and glassmorphism effects (backdrop blur) with physics-based scaling on hover.
- **GSAP ScrollTriggers**: Used for advanced section pinning and synchronized image reveals as the user explores the site.
